# Gym App (Backend)

This is mainly an imitation project of chapter 3 and 4 of the project ["Evolutionary Architecture by Example"](https://github.com/evolutionary-architecture/evolutionary-architecture-by-example) by Maciej "MJ" Jedrzejewski and Kamil Baczek. I'm just going to add authentication and authorization to it, and add customers/users data, and maybe add a few other things.

For more information about the project, see the Architecture Decision Records inside the folder `/architecture-decision-log`.
